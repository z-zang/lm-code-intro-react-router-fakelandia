# Activity 4 - Extensions & Deployment

There are many, many improvements we could make - even to a small app like this.

Here are some ideas for extensions - feel free to implement your own ideas too!

👉 You may have noticed the 1.5s wait when you call `generateMisdemeanours`. If not, try increasing the sleep(1500) in `generateMisdemeanours` until it becomes annoying when you reload. Can you show a nice "loading" message while the fake API is loading?

(Hint: One way to do this could be to add an `isLoading` boolean to state, and using this to conditionally display a loading icon, for example.)

👉 The home page could be more exciting. Maybe you could add some statistics, like "total misdemeanours" or "number of confessions today"?

👉 The Confessions page allows users to add details of their confessions, but that data isn't currently being used anywhere. Maybe you could show it on the misdemeanours page?

👉 How about showing self-confessed misdemeanours in a different colour on the misdemeanours page?

## Deployment

It would be really cool to see the full site live on the internet. Github offer free hosting for simple sites like this via a service called `Github Pages`.

There's an `npm` package called `gh-pages` which makes this super simple:

👉 `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

👉 Add a `homepage` property at the top of your `package.json`, so it looks like this:

```JavaScript
{
  "name": "your-react-app-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}"
  // where {username} is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of your GitHub repository for this app
    // ... rest of package.json follows here...

```

👉 Alter the scripts in package.json by adding a predeploy step and changing the deploy step to push your project to github pages

```JavaScript
// ... package.json scripts section...
"scripts": {
  //...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

👉 Run the command `npm run deploy`

This will build and deploy the app to GitHub pages at the URL you specified in `homepage` above.

## GitHub Pages Settings

❗ It takes a few minutes for the site to be live! In the meantime, let's go look at what `gh-pages` has done. ❗

👉 Go to your github repository for this project, and click `Settings` to view the repo settings. Find the `GitHub Pages` section.

(The settings for GitHub Pages can be found at `github.com/{yourUserName}/{repoName}/settings/pages)

If `gh-pages` worked, then it will have configured these settings for you.

At the top is a notification of the URL that your app will be published at. At first this notification is BLUE - meaning GitHub is still processing your app. If you wait a few minutes and hit refresh it should be GREEN, and then you can navigate to the URL and view your app.

While we're waiting, let's look at the other settings:

First, a new branch has been created, named `gh-pages` by default. This contains the production build of your app - i.e. the actual HTML/JavaScript/CSS combo that we want to send down to users of your app.

Look at the `Source` section. You should be able to see that the repo settings have been automatically set to use the `gh-pages` branch as a source for the page.

Lastly, you can set up a custom domain, so if you own your own domain name then you can publish pages there using GitHub Pages!

## But Wait..!

Once the app is live you might find there are some problems, depending on how your GitHub Pages interacts with React Router.

When you navigate directly to a subpage of your GitHub Page, your browser makes a request to the GitHub Pages server, asking for `/your-app/your-subpage`. But GitHub Pages doesn't know anything about that! As far as it knows, there's just one app, at `/your-app`.

If you were in full control of the hosting server you could configure it to send the same app to every request that starts with `your-app`. But since we're NOT in full control, we have to change the way routing works.

There are several ways to do this, but the easiest (or, at least, laziest 😅) is to change our `<BrowserRouter>` component to a `<HashRouter>`. This changes the URLs for our router to use `#` rather than `/` to separate subpages - so from the server's point of view they're all part of the same page. Our URLs look a bit uglier, but at least it works with our free GitHub Pages hosting!

## Hooray!

You've done it! You've modernised the extremely unusual justice system of Fakelandia, and hopefully had some fun and got to experiment a little in the process.

Have a well-deserved rest and look forward to using all these skills to make some extremely cool apps!
